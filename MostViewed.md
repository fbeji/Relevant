## Tables of Data Needed

### The data needed for my Android App is a list of the  most emailed, shared and viewed articles on the internet. I will need to divide 
my data sheet into columns of different categories based on user intrest. 
columns:     Sports         Politics          Entertainment          Economy        Stocks         General  

those columns are divided into sections (rows) based on subcategories. for example Sports can be Basketball, Soccer, Football etc.
